                          I strive to maintain fair and flexible rates to alleviate the stress associated with budgeting for a recording. My pricing is primarily based on a day rate (8-10 hours) rather than hourly. For attended mixing, the rate is the same as recording. Additionally, I offer per song or album rates for remote mixing. The cost of producing a record varies depending on several factors, and each project is unique. Please feel free to contact me with details about your project, and we can discuss specific pricing.

                                My schedule fluctuates weekly, allowing for occasional short-notice availability. However, I recommend booking appointments preferably a month or two in advance for optimal scheduling.
